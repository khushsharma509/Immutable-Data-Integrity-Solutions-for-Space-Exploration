[![IPFS Enabled](https://img.shields.io/badge/IPFS-Pinata-65C2CB)](https://www.pinata.cloud/)

A next-generation decentralized solution for securing critical space mission data using blockchain anchoring and IPFS storage.

## üîç Problem Statement
**Space exploration generates petabytes of sensitive data** that requires:
- üõ°Ô∏è Protection against tampering/corruption
- üåê Distributed access across international teams
- üïí Historical integrity for multi-decade missions
- üõ∞Ô∏è Resistance to single-point failures in deep space

Traditional centralized storage solutions fail to meet these requirements, risking data integrity for missions costing billions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Our Solution
**Blockchain-Verified Immutable Storage System**
1. **Local AES-256 Encryption** üîí  
   Files encrypted before leaving user devices using Web Crypto API
2. **Pinata IPFS Storage** üåç  
   Encrypted data stored redundantly via Pinata's IPFS network
3. **ExSat Testnet Anchoring** ‚õìÔ∏è  
   Content hashes permanently recorded on ExSat blockchain
4. **Multi-Chain Verification** üîó  
   Proofs stored on ExSat + Bitcoin via OP_RETURN

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Space-Grade Security** ‚ò¢Ô∏è  
  Radiation-hardened protocol with error correction
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** üï∂Ô∏è  
  Verify data existence without revealing contents
- **Interplanetary Latency Tolerance** üõ∞Ô∏è  
  Optimized for high-delay communication environments
- **NASA CRS-2 Compliance** üìú  
  Meets space data integrity standards

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Ethers.js + ExSat Testnet
- **Storage**: Pinata IPFS + Filecoin
- **Encryption**: Web Crypto API (AES-GCM)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + Hardhat

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ & npm
- MetaMask (Configured for ExSat Testnet)
- Pinata API Keys (Get from [Pinata Portal](https://app.pinata.cloud/))

### Installation
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/space-data-integrity.git
cd space-data-integrity
npm install
cp .env.example .env


Add to `.env`:
Pinata Configuration
PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_api_key
PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_pinata_secret_key

ExSat Testnet
EXSAT_RPC_URL=https://evm-tst3.exsat.network
PRIVATE_KEY=your_metamask_private_key
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xD8ab45e342b310F3Ee9cD418e2fB33053fF076eE


### Running the Application
1. Start development server:
npm run dev


2. Access the application at:
http://localhost:3000


## üåê System Architecture
1. User Interface (Frontend)
Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS

Provides a secure, user-friendly web interface for:

Uploading files

Encrypting files locally (AES-256)

Connecting a crypto wallet (MetaMask/exSat)

Viewing and verifying stored data

2. Client-Side Encryption
Files are encrypted in the browser using the Web Crypto API before leaving the user‚Äôs device.

Only the encrypted data is uploaded, ensuring zero-knowledge for the backend and storage layers.

3. Decentralized Storage Layer (IPFS via Pinata)
Encrypted files are uploaded to IPFS through Pinata‚Äôs API.

IPFS returns a Content Identifier (CID)-a unique hash representing the encrypted file.

Data is redundantly stored and distributed across the global IPFS network, ensuring high availability and censorship resistance.

4. Blockchain Anchoring Layer (ExSat Testnet)
The CID is anchored on the ExSat blockchain by calling a smart contract via Ethers.js.

The smart contract records:

The CID

Timestamp

User‚Äôs wallet address

Optionally, Bitcoin block hash (if using ExSat‚Äôs hybrid consensus features)

This provides immutable, tamper-proof, and time-stamped proof of data existence and integrity.

5. Verification & Retrieval
Anyone can:

Query the smart contract for a CID to verify its existence, timestamp, and owner

Retrieve the encrypted file from IPFS using the CID

Decrypt the file locally with the correct key and IV

6. Security Features
End-to-end encryption: Only users with the key can decrypt the data.

No single point of failure: Data and proof are distributed and decentralized.

Auditability: All anchoring and access events are publicly verifiable on-chain.
